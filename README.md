# Setup

- Clone repo into `.dotfiles` in home directory
- Source Brewfile with `brew bundle`
- Set Warp font to Hack (Nerd Font version)
- Run `rcup` from within .dotfiles
- Run `init` to run the init script from `./zshrc`

# To-do list

- [ ] Devcontainers: Figure out a way to handle these in the nvim setup without vscode

## Neovim
- [ ] Explore docker-integrations

## Tmux 
- [ ] Hotkeys for swapping panes like in Warp - `Cmd+[` & `Cmd+]`
- [ ] Set up tmuxp presets for common projectsss
    - Ideally these can be specified in git for common stuff, but also on each computer for individual projects that are not shared across computers
